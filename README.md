# Cyclistic

The project involves analyzing a dataset of Cyclistic bike rides from 2020. The dataset includes information about the start and end times of rides, the start and end station IDs, the bike type, and the member type (annual or casual).

The analysis will focus on the following questions:

How do the ride patterns of annual members and casual riders differ?
What factors influence whether a casual rider becomes an annual member?
What marketing strategies can Cyclistic use to convert casual riders into annual members?
Visualization

The analysis will be presented using a variety of data visualization techniques, such as charts, graphs, and maps. This will help to communicate the findings of the analysis in a clear and concise way.

Outcomes

The project will provide Cyclistic with valuable insights into the usage patterns of its annual members and casual riders. This information can be used to develop a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
